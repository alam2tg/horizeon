# Project Horiseon

## Code Refactor Example
Changed <div> headers to section to represent different sections of the web page.
![headers-before](assets/images/headers-before.png)
![headers-after](assets/images/headers-after.png)

Changed h1 to class "title" to define h1 as separate while making adjustments in CSS. 
![class-title](assets/images/class-title.png)

Changed h3 div to a class called "Services". Deleted ul/li lines because they were preventing h3 headers to align horizontally.

![headers-h3-class-services](assets/images/header-h3-class-services.png)

Changed CSS to address new classes: Title and Service.
![class-title](assets/images/class-title.png)

Added alt-accessibility.

## Usage
To use this guide, review the notation of the Code Refactor Examples, then reference the images. 

To navigate the Horiseon browser, right click the browser, then click "Inspect".
This will create a terminal for you to use as a guide. Click the "Elements" tab at top, then follow the section path shown below.

By hovering over the "Sections", you can see each element of the code being highlighted. To access alt-accessibility descriptions, click the arrows of each "Section" and you will see the alt-accesibility descriptions at the end of <img> lines. 

## Learning Points
- Sections are important to properly divide the headers of your HTML document. Not only does it provide a framework for your code, but when "Inspected" in browser, it's core for navigation.
- I learned that ul/li lists will prevent a css <inline-block> from putting elements in-line.
- Creating classes is core for organizing and identifying your elements in HTML and CSS. 
- Adding alt-accessibility for images is important for being inclusive towards visitors, as well as meticulous with your code.
